#### _Description_
	This site uses the concepts of RESTful routing to set up Dictionary web application. 
	It uses two classes: Word and Definition in a one to many relationship. 
	The user can add as many words ad possible and add as many definitions as possible to each word. 
	Restful web pages are routered and rendered through the Spark Framework. 
	Velocity tool is used to create html (with lightweight java code) templates for our Spark routines (get/post etc).
	VelocityTemplateEngine is used as an adapter to add Velocity templates to our Spark routines.	
	The code was designed using Behavoir Driven Development (BDD) testing principles. 
	The unit testing of the backend is done using jUnit. 
	The integration testing of the user interface was done using Selenium Webdriver tests and a FluentLenium Adapter. 
	All testing dependencies were managed using Gradle.

#### _Setup/Installation Requirements_	 
 	Clone this repository
	Install Gradle (a build & test automation program that will manage all our dependencies)
	Build in the terminal using 'gradle run' command
	Open localhost:4567 in any browser to use the web application
	Start adding words to the dictionary
	No database backing
